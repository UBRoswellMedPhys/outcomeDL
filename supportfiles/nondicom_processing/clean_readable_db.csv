Pathology was revealing for invasive, keratinizing, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (pT4aN3b) with adverse pathology features of positive surgical margins, extranodal extension, lymphovascular invasion, and perineural invasion.    The patient was referred to radiation medicine for consideration of postoperative radiation therapy.  In the interim, patient had healing complications including fistula development.  The patient was recommended for postoperative radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy; however, postsurgical restaging imaging to include ultrasound and PET scan was concerning for recurrent disease.
